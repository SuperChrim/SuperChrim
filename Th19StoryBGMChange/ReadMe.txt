This patch changes all the music that plays in story mode to the characters themes that play in VS mode. (Excluding Reimu in Zanmu's Story)
I also included alternate msg files that keep Zanmu's these for the final boss for all stories.
If you prefer the final bosses that are not Zanmu to continue to have Zanmu's theme, replace the current msg files with the ones in the alt folder.
