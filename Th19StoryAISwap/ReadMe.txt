This mod is a binhack that that makes the normally AI controlled P2 in story mode human controlled.
Yes, that means the you go to the next stage when you lose and you get a game over then you win.
To make things a bit more interactive, the meterless attacks no longer happen, and you charge up your meter to do them like normal.
You can also configure whether P1 in controlled by an AI or remains human controlled as well.

IMPORTANT!
When a stage completes, you must press the Enter key to advance to the next stage. No other button will work.
