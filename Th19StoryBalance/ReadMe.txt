These balance changes only effect story mode. VS and Online mode are unaffected.
What this patch changes:
 - Enemies no longer spawn during boss attacks.
 - Boss attacks have increased health and time.
 - Overall boss difficulty is increased.
 - Final boss attacks have a unique death. (Just for some visual difference)
 - Unused attack animation are added for Hisami and Zanmu bosses
