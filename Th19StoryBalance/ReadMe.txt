These balance changes only effect story mode. VS and Online mode are unaffected.
What this patch changes:
 - Enemies no longer spawn during boss attacks.
 - Boss attacks have increased health and time.
 - Overall boss difficulty is increased.
 - Final boss attacks have a unique death. (Just for some visual difference)
 - Unused attack animation are added for Hisami and Zanmu bosses

If you want to use this alongside my Th19Balance patch,
take the files in the alt folder and replace the ones of the same name inside the th19 folder.
Please note that doing so WILL affect VS and Online mode.
